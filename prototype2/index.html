Here's the HTML code for a login page for the company "Instagram," using a stylesheet called "style.css" and an image called "logo.png" (which should be displayed in a smaller, mini size):```<!DOCTYPE html><html><head>  <title>Instagram - Login</title>  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"></head><body>  <div class="logo">    <img src="logo.png" alt="Instagram Logo" width="50" height="50">  </div>  <div class="login-form">    <h1>Log in to Instagram</h1>    <form action="#" method="POST">      <label for="username">Username:</label>      <input type="text" id="username" name="username">      <label for="password">Password:</label>      <input type="password" id="password" name="password">      <input type="submit" value="Log In">    </form>  </div></body></html>```Note that the above code assumes that you have a "style.css" file and an "logo.png" image in the root directory of your project, and that they are properly linked to this HTML file via their respective file paths. Additionally, the code above uses some basic CSS classes to style the logo image and form, so make sure those styles are defined in your "style.css" file as well.
