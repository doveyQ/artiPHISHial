                                    <p>
										Ideally, use a randomly generated master password.
									<p>
										A good example is: <span>r50$K28vaIFiYxaY</span>
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
										<em>Tip:</em> Use the LastPass <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/features/password-generator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">password generator</a> to create a strong, unique master password.

If you have trouble with this method, we recommend using one of those extensions.  If you must use JavaScript to generate your sharing keys, we recommend Google Chrome, as its JavaScript engine is many times faster than any other browser.  Internet Explorer's JavaScript engine is many times slower than other browsers, so it's doubtful that it will work at all. If you experience slow script warnings during this process, be sure to choose to let the script continue to run.":"To generate sharing keys, use the LastPass extension on a modern browser.
